"""
First, let’s talk about lint. Those tiny, annoying little defects that somehow get all over your clothes. Clothes look and feel much better without all that lint. Your code is no different. Little mistakes, stylistic inconsistencies, and dangerous logic don’t make your code feel great.

But we all make mistakes. You can’t expect yourself to always catch them in time. Mistyped variable names, forgetting a closing bracket, incorrect indentation in Python, calling a function with the wrong number of arguments, the list goes on and on. Linters help to identify those problem areas.

Additionally, most editors and IDEs have the ability to run linters in the background as you type. This results in an environment capable of highlighting, underlining, or otherwise identifying problem areas in the code before you run it. It is like an advanced spell-check for code. It underlines issues in squiggly red lines much like your favorite word processor does.

Linters analyze code to detect various categories of lint. Those categories can be broadly defined as the following:

Logical Lint
Code errors
Code with potentially unintended results
Dangerous code patterns
Stylistic Lint
Code not conforming to defined conventions
